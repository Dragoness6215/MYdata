# MYdata
MYdata is an application combined with a wearable device used to assist in Small Data collection. Small Data is smaller data sets used for personal insights. It focuses on a single concept and seeks to answer a question. An accessible way to collect, store, and process Small Data is needed.
The device registers when a button is pressed and sends a signal over Bluetooth Low Energy to the mobile application. The device stores data whenever it is not connected to the application and sends it when connected. The device is inexpensive and easy to construct. 
The application stores and processes the data, which is displayed in a variety of graphs and can be exported as a png and the raw data as an email. Anyone with coding experience can design new graphs.
